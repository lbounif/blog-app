Instead, this release is primarily focused on making it easier to upgrade React itself.We’re actively working on the new React features, but they’re not a part of this release. The React 17 release is a key part of our strategy to roll them out without leaving anyone behind.In particular, React 17 is a “stepping stone” release that makes it safer to embed a tree managed by one version of React inside a tree managed by a different version of React.",
